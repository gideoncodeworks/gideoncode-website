# Gideon AI Chatbot - Client Outreach Email Templates

## Template 1: The Quick Idea Email (Existing Web Clients)

**Subject:** Quick idea for [ClientName]'s website

Hey [Client],

Remember that AI CRM I built for my business? I just packaged the chatbot piece as a standalone product.

It's called Gideon - basically gives your website a 24/7 AI assistant that:
- Answers visitor questions in real-time
- Captures leads even at 2am
- Sounds natural (not like a crappy chatbot)
- Learns about YOUR business specifically

I'm offering it to my existing clients first at **$199/month** (normally $299).

Want to see a 5-minute demo? I can show you exactly what it would look like on [ClientName].com.

Let me know!

## Template 2: The Problem/Solution Email

**Subject:** Are you losing leads after hours?

Hey [Client],

Quick question: How many people visit [ClientName].com when you're not available?

Probably more than you think. And most of them leave without contacting you.

I built something that solves this: **Gideon AI Chatbot**.

**What it does:**
- Engages visitors 24/7 with intelligent conversation
- Answers FAQs about your services automatically
- Captures contact info and books appointments
- Routes qualified leads to you in real-time

**The ROI:**
Even one extra client/month makes it profitable. Most businesses see 3-5x more leads captured.

**Special pricing for you:**
- ~~$299/month~~ **$199/month** for existing clients
- $497 setup (we customize it for your business)
- Live in 1 week

I can show you a demo using your actual website. 10 minutes. Worth it?

## Template 3: The Proof Email (For Skeptics)

**Subject:** See this AI chatbot work on my site right now

[Client],

Go to gideoncode.com

Click the chat button in the bottom right (says "GC")

Ask it anything: "What's the difference between plans?" or "How much does an app cost?"

**That's Gideon.** Same AI we're offering to put on YOUR site.

Here's the crazy part - it's been live for 2 weeks and:
- Captured 47 leads we would have missed
- Answered 200+ questions automatically
- Works while I sleep/eat/work

It pays for itself with literally one extra client.

Want it on [ClientName].com? I'll give you my client rate: **$199/mo** instead of $299.

Setup takes 1 week. I handle everything.

Interested?

## Template 4: The ROI Calculator Email

**Subject:** Quick math on missed opportunities

[Client],

Let's do some quick math on [ClientName]:

**Current situation:**
- ~[X] visitors/month to your website
- Maybe 2-3% contact you = [Y] leads
- But you miss 50% because you're busy/sleeping = [Z] actual conversations
- If you close 20% = [W] clients/month

**With Gideon AI:**
- Same [X] visitors
- 5% engage with chatbot = [2Y] conversations
- 100% captured (AI never sleeps) = [2Y] qualified leads
- 20% close = [4W] clients/month

**Difference:** [3W] additional clients/month

If each client is worth $[AvgValue] to you, that's **$[3W*AvgValue] more revenue/month**.

Gideon costs $199/month (my client rate).

Even in the worst case, 1 extra client pays for it 10x over.

Want to see it in action? I can set up a demo using your actual services in 48 hours.

## Template 6: The Urgency Email (Limited Spots)

**Subject:** 3 spots left for Feb setup

[Client],

Quick heads up - I'm limiting Gideon deployments to **5 new clients in February** so I can give everyone white-glove setup.

I've got 2 slots left, and I'm offering them to my existing clients first.

**Your spot is reserved until Friday.**

After that, I'm opening it up to the waitlist and pricing goes back to $299/month.

**To claim your spot at $199/mo:**
1. Reply "YES" to this email
2. I'll send the setup questionnaire
3. We schedule your persona call
4. Go live in 2 weeks

Let me know by Friday if you want in.

## Template 7: The Case Study Email (After Your First Success)

**Subject:** How [OtherClient] got 23 leads in 2 weeks with Gideon

Hey [Client],

Wanted to share a quick win.

[OtherClient] launched Gideon AI on their site 2 weeks ago.

**Results so far:**
- 23 qualified leads captured (5 closed already)
- 187 conversations handled automatically
- $0 in additional staff costs
- Working while they sleep

One of the leads came in at 2:47am. Booked an appointment for the next day. That client is now worth $4,500 to them.

**The math:**
- Cost: $199/month = $398 for 2 weeks
- Revenue: $4,500 from 1 late-night lead
- ROI: 1,130%

Want me to set you up with the same system?

## PHONE SCRIPT (If Calling Instead of Email)

**Opening:**
"Hey [Client], it's Josh from Gideon Code Works. Got 5 minutes? I built something new for your website."

**Pitch:**
"You know that AI CRM I built for my business? I packaged the chatbot part as a product. It's like having a smart assistant on your site 24/7 answering questions and capturing leads.

The crazy part - it's already live on my site and caught 47 leads in 2 weeks that I would have totally missed.

I'm offering it to my existing clients at $199/month instead of the normal $299. Want to see it in action?"

**Handling Objections:**

*"That sounds expensive"*
"What's one new client worth to you? Most people make back the $199 with literally one lead. And this thing works around the clock."

*"Can't I just use a regular chatbot?"*
"Regular chatbots are garbage - canned responses, frustrate users. This is real AI. Same tech as ChatGPT. It actually understands context. Want to see the difference?"

*"What if it gives wrong info?"*
"We train it specifically on YOUR business. It doesn't make stuff up. If it doesn't know something, it says so and captures their contact info for you to follow up."

*"I need to think about it"*
"Totally fair. How about this - let me set up a demo on a test page so you can see exactly what it would look like for [ClientName]. Takes me 30 minutes. Then you can decide. Sound good?"

**Close:**
"Awesome. I'll send you a quick email with the demo link and pricing. If you like it, we can go live next week. Cool?"

## BEST PRACTICES

### Timing
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm (best open rates)
- Follow up once after 3 days if no response
- Don't spam - max 2 emails per prospect

### Personalization
- Use their actual business name
- Reference specific pain points for their industry
- Mention previous work you've done for them

### Offer Structure
- Lead with value, not features
- Use social proof (demo on your site, other clients)
- Create urgency (limited slots, early bird pricing)
- Make next step easy ("Reply YES")

### Pricing Strategy
- Start with discount for existing clients ($199 vs $299)
- Time-limited offers work well
- Bundle setup fee into first month if needed to close

### Success Metrics to Track
- Email open rate (aim for 30%+)
- Response rate (aim for 15%+)
- Demo-to-close rate (aim for 50%+)
- Time to first paying customer (target: 1 week)

## GOAL: First 5 Paying Customers in 30 Days

**Week 1:** Email 20 existing web clients with Template 1 or 2
**Week 2:** Follow up with non-responders, do demos for interested
**Week 3:** Close first 2-3 clients, get them live
**Week 4:** Get testimonials, email next 20 prospects with social proof

Once you have 5 paying customers at $199-299/mo, you have:
- $995-1,495/month recurring revenue
- Proof it works
- Case studies for scaling
- Foundation to build to 20-50 clients

Good luck! 🚀
