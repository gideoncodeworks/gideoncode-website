## 🎯 **What is a CMS?**

A **Content Management System (CMS)** is a web-based admin panel that lets you edit your website without touching code. Think of it like the "admin dashboard" of your site — you log in, click edit, make changes, and publish.

**Your hosting-only plan includes:**
- ✅ Full CMS access (WordPress, Sanity, or Contentful)
- ✅ Ability to manage your own content
- ✅ Training + video tutorials
- ✅ PDF guides for common tasks

**What you can do yourself:**
- Edit text, images, and videos
- Add/remove pages (using templates we built)
- Update blog posts
- Change prices, hours, contact info
- Upload photos to galleries
- Manage products (if you have e-commerce)

**What you should call us for ($75/hr):**
- Design changes (colors, fonts, layout)
- New custom features
- Security updates
- Database issues
- Plugin conflicts
