          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I didn't set out to build an AI product.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I was just trying to replace the shitty chatbot on my website.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold gradient-text mb-6 mt-12">The Setup</h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I was building a CRM for Gideon Codeworks. Standard stuff—lead management, deal tracking, client communications. But I wanted it smarter. I wanted an AI assistant that could actually help me run the business.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            So I started building one.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I had Claude Code in my terminal. GPT-4 for different angles. And I started experimenting: <strong>What if I built an AI that could orchestrate both of them?</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Get Claude's deep reasoning when I needed strategy. Get GPT's speed when I needed quick answers. Route between them intelligently. Combine their outputs.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I built it to power the CRM. To handle lead scoring, task prioritization, client questions—all the operational stuff I didn't want to do manually.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            And it worked. Really well.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold gradient-text mb-6 mt-12">The Deployment</h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Then I looked at gideoncode.com.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I had one of those generic AI chatbot widgets. You know the kind—barely works, gives canned responses, frustrates visitors more than it helps them.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I thought: <strong>Why not deploy my AI assistant here instead?</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            So I did. I took Gideon—the AI I'd built to power my CRM—and deployed it on my website to replace that useless chatbot.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            It could answer questions about Gideon Codeworks. Explain our services. Talk to potential clients. Route conversations to me when needed. Actually be helpful instead of just pretending to be.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I deployed it. Tested it. It worked great.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            And then I showed Claude (in chat) what I'd done.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold gradient-text mb-6 mt-12">The "Holy Shit" Moment</h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            That's when Claude said: <strong>"Do you know what you just did?"</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I didn't.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I thought I'd just built a better chatbot for my website.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Claude pointed out what I'd actually built:
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>An AI assistant that can be white-labeled and deployed on ANY website.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>An orchestration layer that intelligently routes between Claude and GPT-4.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>A system that learns a business's context and can represent them 24/7.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>Something that could be implemented on thousands of websites, not just mine.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            He was like: "Holy shit. You need to sell this."
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I'd been so focused on solving my own problem—building a better AI for MY business—that I didn't see what I'd accidentally created.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            A standalone product.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold gradient-text mb-6 mt-12">What Gideon Actually Is</h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>Gideon is the AI assistant I built to power my CRM.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            But it turns out it can power a lot more than that.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Here's what makes it different from every other "AI chatbot" on the market:
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>It orchestrates multiple AIs.</strong> Not just one model giving canned responses. Gideon routes queries between Claude and GPT-4 based on what each is best at. Deep reasoning questions? Claude. Quick answers? GPT. Complex analysis? Both, combined intelligently.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>It learns your business.</strong> Not generic responses. Gideon understands your services, your pricing, your process, your voice. It represents YOUR business, not a template.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>It's actually useful.</strong> Most chatbots frustrate visitors. Gideon actually helps them—answers real questions, qualifies leads, routes to humans when needed, learns from every interaction.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>It can be white-labeled.</strong> The same AI that powers gideoncode.com can be deployed on your website with your branding, your business knowledge, your voice.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>It took four weeks to build.</strong> Because I had Claude Code and GPT-4 helping me build it. Not a team of 10 developers over 18 months. Me, solving my problem, accidentally building a product.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold gradient-text mb-6 mt-12">The Accident</h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I built Gideon for my CRM.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I deployed it on my website to replace a shitty chatbot.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Claude pointed out I'd accidentally built a standalone product.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Now other businesses want it.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            That's the story.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            No grand vision. No pitch deck. No "we're revolutionizing AI." Just: <strong>I had a problem, I built a solution, and I didn't realize what I had until someone else pointed it out.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold gradient-text mb-6 mt-12">Why "Gideon"?</h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Gideon is my middle name. Joshua Gideon Stone.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The biblical Gideon had 300 men who fought like 10,000.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I built an AI that orchestrates Claude and GPT-4 to work like a team.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            I named it after myself before I knew it would become a product. Now that feels weirdly appropriate.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold gradient-text mb-6 mt-12">What Happened Next</h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Once I realized what I'd built, I couldn't unsee it.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Every website I looked at had those garbage AI chatbots. You know the ones—they can barely answer basic questions, they frustrate visitors, they're basically just glorified FAQs with a chat interface.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            And I had an AI that actually worked. That could learn any business. That could be deployed on any site.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>The CRM is still a thing.</strong> It's running Gideon Codeworks right now. Fully integrated with Gideon, the AI assistant that makes it smart.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>But Gideon itself became the product.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Because here's what I realized: if I needed an AI that actually represents my business instead of giving canned chatbot responses, how many other founders need exactly that?
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Agencies who want their websites to convert better. SaaS companies who need AI support without hiring teams. Service businesses who want 24/7 client assistance that doesn't suck.
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            They all need Gideon. They just don't know it exists yet.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold gradient-text mb-6 mt-12">The Innovation (That I Didn't Know I Was Building)</h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Here's what I accidentally figured out:
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <strong>You don't need to build a better AI model. You need to orchestrate the ones that exist.</strong>
