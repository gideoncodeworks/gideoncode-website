          5 Website Mistakes That Are Costing You Customers
        </h1>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          You have a website. That's good. But is it actually working for you—or quietly driving customers to your competitors? Here are the five mistakes I see killing conversions on small business websites every single day.
        </p>
      </header>

      <!-- Article Content -->
      <div class="prose prose-invert prose-lg max-w-none space-y-8">

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I've audited hundreds of small business websites. And I see the same problems over and over again. Not design problems. Not technology problems. <strong class="text-white">Business-killing problems</strong> that owners don't even know they have.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The worst part? These aren't hard to fix. Most take less than an hour. But every day you don't fix them, you're losing customers to businesses that did.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Let me show you what to look for.

        <hr class="border-cyan-500/30 my-12">

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">Mistake #1: Your Site Takes Forever to Load</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          This is the silent killer. You can't see it because you're on fast Wi-Fi. But your customers? They're on their phones at a red light, waiting for your page to load. And they're not waiting long.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-900/20 border border-red-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-red-400 mb-4">The Numbers Don't Lie:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">53% of mobile users</strong> leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds to load</li>
            <li>• Every additional second of load time <strong class="text-white">drops conversions by 7%</strong></li>
            <li>• Google penalizes slow sites in search rankings</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white">How to check:</strong> Go to <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev" target="_blank" class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 underline">PageSpeed Insights</a> and enter your URL. If your mobile score is below 50, you have a problem.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-cyan-900/20 border border-cyan-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">Quick Fixes:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• Compress your images (most sites have massive unoptimized photos)</li>
            <li>• Remove plugins and scripts you're not using</li>
            <li>• Switch to better hosting (cheap hosting = slow site)</li>
            <li>• Enable browser caching</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">Mistake #2: Nobody Can Find Your Phone Number</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I see this constantly. Someone lands on your website ready to call—and they have to hunt for your phone number. It's buried in the footer. Or it's only on the contact page. Or worse, it's an image that can't be clicked on mobile.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white">Every extra click is a customer lost.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Think about it: Someone searches "plumber near me" at 10pm with water spraying everywhere. They click your site. They need to call you NOW. If they can't find the number in 2 seconds, they're hitting back and calling the next result.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-cyan-900/20 border border-cyan-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">The Fix:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• Put your phone number in the header—visible on every page</li>
            <li>• Make it a clickable link: <code class="bg-black/50 px-2 py-1 rounded text-cyan-300">tel:+1234567890</code></li>
            <li>• On mobile, consider a sticky "Call Now" button</li>
            <li>• Test it: Can your mom find your number in under 3 seconds?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">Mistake #3: Your Site Looks Broken on Phones</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          "But I checked it on my computer and it looks fine!"
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Yeah, but <strong class="text-white">60-70% of your traffic is on mobile.</strong> And if your site looks like garbage on a phone—text too small, buttons impossible to tap, images overflowing—those visitors are gone.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">Common Mobile Disasters:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• Text so small you need a magnifying glass</li>
            <li>• Buttons too close together (fat finger syndrome)</li>
            <li>• Horizontal scrolling (instant bounce)</li>
            <li>• Popups that can't be closed on mobile</li>
            <li>• Forms that are impossible to fill out</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white">How to check:</strong> Actually look at your site on your phone. Not a simulator—your actual phone. Try to do what a customer would do. Book an appointment. Find your address. Fill out a form. Is it easy or frustrating?
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">Mistake #4: You Don't Tell Visitors What to Do</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Someone lands on your homepage. They read about your services. They think "this looks good." And then... what?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          If you don't tell them exactly what to do next, they do nothing. They leave. They forget about you.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          This is called a <strong class="text-white">Call to Action (CTA)</strong>—and most small business websites either don't have one, or have one so weak it might as well not exist.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-900/20 border border-red-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-red-400 mb-4">Weak CTAs That Don't Convert:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• "Submit" (submit what? to whom?)</li>
            <li>• "Learn More" (vague and uninspiring)</li>
            <li>• "Contact Us" buried at the bottom of the page</li>
            <li>• No CTA at all—just information with no next step</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-cyan-900/20 border border-cyan-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">CTAs That Actually Work:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• "Get Your Free Quote" (specific, valuable)</li>
            <li>• "Book Your Appointment" (clear action)</li>
            <li>• "Call Now: 555-123-4567" (removes friction)</li>
            <li>• "See Our Work" → "Get Started" (guided journey)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-cyan-300 text-sm mt-4">Rule of thumb: Every page should have ONE clear thing you want visitors to do.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">Mistake #5: You're Invisible on Google</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          You have a website. Great. But if nobody can find it, what's the point?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I talk to business owners all the time who say "I have a website but it doesn't bring in any business." When I check, their site doesn't show up for ANY relevant searches. Not even when searching their exact business name.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">Why You're Not Showing Up:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">No Google Business Profile</strong> – This is free and essential for local businesses</li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">No location information</strong> – Google doesn't know where you are</li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">Generic page titles</strong> – "Home" instead of "Cleveland Plumbing | 24/7 Emergency Service"</li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">No content about what you do</strong> – Two sentences isn't enough for Google to understand your business</li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">Not mobile-friendly</strong> – Google punishes non-mobile sites in rankings</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white">Quick test:</strong> Open an incognito window and search "[your service] + [your city]". Do you show up on the first page? If not, you're invisible to everyone who didn't already know your name.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-cyan-900/20 border border-cyan-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">Start Here:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>1. Claim your <a href="https://business.google.com" target="_blank" class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 underline">Google Business Profile</a> (if you haven't)</li>
            <li>2. Add your city/service area to your homepage and page titles</li>
            <li>3. Write actual content about your services—aim for 300+ words per service</li>
            <li>4. Get reviews (Google loves businesses with reviews)</li>
          </ul>
