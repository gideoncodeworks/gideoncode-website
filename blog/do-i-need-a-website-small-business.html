          Do I Need a Website for My Small Business?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Social media is free. A website costs money. So why would you pay for something when you can post on Instagram for free? Here's the honest answer from someone who builds websites for a living.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">The Short Answer</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <strong class="text-white">Yes, you probably need a website.</strong> But not for the reasons most people think.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          You don't need a website because "everyone has one." You don't need a website because some marketing guru told you to. You need a website because <strong class="text-white">people are going to Google your business before they call you</strong>—and what they find (or don't find) determines whether they become a customer.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Let me break down exactly when you need one, when you can wait, and what it's actually costing you to not have one.
        </p>

        <hr class="border-cyan-500/30 my-12">

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">"But I Have Social Media..."</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          This is the #1 thing I hear. And I get it. Social media is free, you're already posting there, and it feels like you're "online." So why pay for a website?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Here's the problem: <strong class="text-white">you don't own social media.</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="bg-cyan-900/20 border border-cyan-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">Things That Can Kill Your Social Media Business Overnight:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• Algorithm changes (Instagram reach dropped 50% in 2024)</li>
            <li>• Account gets hacked or suspended</li>
            <li>• Platform changes rules (remember when Facebook killed organic reach?)</li>
            <li>• Platform dies (RIP Vine, MySpace, and eventually... TikTok?)</li>
            <li>• Your competitors pay for ads, you disappear</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I'm not saying quit social media. I'm saying <strong class="text-white">don't build your entire business on rented land.</strong> Use social media to attract people. Use your website to convert them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">What a Website Does That Social Media Can't</h2>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">1. You Show Up When People Search</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">When someone Googles "plumber near me" or "best bakery in Cleveland," websites show up. Instagram posts don't. If you're not on Google, you don't exist to anyone who doesn't already follow you.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">2. You Control the Message</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">On social media, your content is mixed with memes, ads, and your competitor's posts. On your website, YOU control what people see. No distractions. Just your business, your story, your call to action.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">3. You Look Legitimate</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Right or wrong, people assume businesses with websites are more established than businesses with just social media. A website says "I'm a real business." An Instagram-only presence says "I might be a side hustle."</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">4. You Can Actually Sell</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Want to take bookings? Collect payments? Show your full menu or service list? Websites do that. Social media links out to other apps, losing customers at every step.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">5. You Own It Forever</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Your website is yours. Your domain is yours. If you switch web designers, you keep everything. If Instagram shuts down tomorrow, your website is still there.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">Industries Where You DEFINITELY Need a Website</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Some businesses can survive on social media alone. Most can't. Here's where a website isn't optional:
        </p>

        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-8">
          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-green-500/30 rounded-lg p-4">
            <p class="text-green-400 font-bold mb-2">Local Service Businesses</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">Plumbers, electricians, HVAC, landscaping, cleaning services, contractors. People Google these. Period.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-green-500/30 rounded-lg p-4">
            <p class="text-green-400 font-bold mb-2">Professional Services</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">Lawyers, accountants, consultants, coaches. Credibility matters. A website is your digital business card.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-green-500/30 rounded-lg p-4">
            <p class="text-green-400 font-bold mb-2">Restaurants & Food</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">People look up menus, hours, and locations. If they can't find you, they eat somewhere else.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-green-500/30 rounded-lg p-4">
            <p class="text-green-400 font-bold mb-2">Health & Wellness</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">Gyms, salons, spas, therapists, chiropractors. Booking online is expected now.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-green-500/30 rounded-lg p-4">
            <p class="text-green-400 font-bold mb-2">Real Estate & Property</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">Agents, property managers, vacation rentals. Listings need a home.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-green-500/30 rounded-lg p-4">
            <p class="text-green-400 font-bold mb-2">Anyone Selling Products</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">E-commerce isn't optional anymore. People expect to browse and buy online.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">When You Might Be Able to Wait</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I'm not going to lie to you to make a sale. There ARE situations where you can delay getting a website:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-300 my-6">
          <li><strong class="text-white">You're testing a business idea</strong> – Validate with social media first. If nobody bites, you didn't waste money on a website.</li>
          <li><strong class="text-white">You only need a few clients</strong> – If you're a freelancer who gets work through referrals and can't take more work anyway, you might not need one yet.</li>
          <li><strong class="text-white">You're broke broke</strong> – I'd rather you keep the lights on. But budget for a website within 3-6 months.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          But here's the thing: even in these cases, you're leaving money on the table. The question isn't "can I survive without a website?" It's "how much is not having one costing me?"
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">The Real Cost of NOT Having a Website</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Let's do some math.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-900/20 border border-red-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-red-400 mb-4">Example: Local Contractor</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• Average job value: <strong class="text-white">$2,500</strong></li>
            <li>• Leads lost per month because you don't show up on Google: <strong class="text-white">5</strong></li>
            <li>• Conversion rate if you had a website: <strong class="text-white">20%</strong></li>
            <li>• Jobs lost per month: <strong class="text-white">1</strong></li>
            <li>• Annual cost of no website: <strong class="text-red-400">$30,000</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-4">A website costs $2,000-5,000. It pays for itself in 1-2 months.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          This isn't some marketing fantasy. I've seen it happen. Businesses that think they're "doing fine" with just social media are actually bleeding customers they never knew existed—because those customers Googled, found nothing, and called someone else.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">What Kind of Website Do You Actually Need?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          You don't need a 50-page website with all the bells and whistles. Here's what actually matters:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-cyan-900/20 border border-cyan-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-4">The Bare Minimum (Better Than Nothing):</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">Who you are</strong> – Your business name and what you do</li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">What you offer</strong> – Services or products, even just a list</li>
            <li>• <strong class="text-white">Where you are</strong> – If you're local, your service area</li>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Getting a website doesn't have to be complicated. Here's the simple path:

            <div>
              <p class="text-white font-bold">Decide: DIY or Done-For-You</p>
              <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">DIY (Wix, Squarespace) is cheaper but takes your time. Done-for-you costs more but you focus on your business.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">Can I just use social media instead of a website?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Social media is great for engagement, but you don't own it. Algorithms change, accounts get hacked, and platforms die. A website is your permanent home base that you control. Use both—social media to attract people, website to convert them.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">How much does a small business website cost?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Basic websites range from $50-200/month for managed services, or $2,500-5,000 one-time for custom builds. DIY builders like Wix are $15-40/month but require your time. The real question is what's it costing you to NOT have one. <a href="small-business-website-cost-2025.html" class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 underline">Read our full pricing breakdown.</a></p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">What if I'm just starting out and have no money?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Start with a Google Business Profile (free) and social media. But budget for a website within 3-6 months. The longer you wait, the more credibility and customers you're leaving on the table.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">Do I need a website if I only do word-of-mouth business?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Yes. Even word-of-mouth referrals will Google you before calling. If they find nothing (or worse, a competitor), you lose the referral. A simple website confirms you're legitimate and tells them how to contact you.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">What's the minimum I need on a website?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">At minimum: who you are, what you do, where you're located (if local), and how to contact you. That's it. A single page with those four things is better than no website at all.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Do you need a website? <strong class="text-white">Almost certainly yes.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Not because I want to sell you one. Because people are Googling your business right now, and if they don't find you, they're finding your competitor instead.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          A website isn't an expense. It's an investment that pays for itself every time someone finds you instead of someone else.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Start simple. Get online. Upgrade later. But don't wait until "someday." Someday is costing you money every day it doesn't come.
