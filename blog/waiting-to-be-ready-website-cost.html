          Marcus waited for the perfect website. Dave started with "good enough." Five years later, one has two trucks and an employee. The other is still grinding 80-hour weeks alone. This is a story about what waiting to be "ready" really costs.

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-xl italic">
          Let me tell you about Marcus and Dave.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-black/60 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-xl p-8 my-8 space-y-6">
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            They met at a supply house in 2019. Both were buying PEX fittings. Both had just quit their jobs at bigger companies to start their own plumbing businesses. They grabbed coffee, swapped numbers, complained about their old bosses. Instant friendship.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Marcus was the planner. Meticulous. He had spreadsheets for everything—startup costs, tool lists, a five-year projection. He'd set up a Facebook page and figured that was enough for now. He told Dave he was going to wait on the website until he "had his branding figured out." He wanted it to be professional. Represent the business right. "Maybe next quarter," he said.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Dave was scrappier. He'd thrown up a basic website the week before—spent $1,200 on a template someone customized for him. It wasn't fancy. The logo was just his name in a nice font. But it existed. "It's embarrassing," he told Marcus, laughing. "But at least people can Google me and find something real."
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Year One</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Both guys hustled. Knocked on doors. Passed out cards at Home Depot. Begged friends and family for referrals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Marcus stayed busy—word of mouth was working. He kept meaning to get that website done, but there was always a job to finish first. "I'll do it when things slow down," he told himself.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Dave's site started showing up on Google. Nothing crazy—page two for "plumber in Lakewood." But when someone's toilet was flooding at 2am, they weren't picky about page rankings. They called whoever showed up. Dave started getting calls from strangers. One or two a month at first. Then more.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Year Two</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Marcus got quotes from three web designers. One wanted $5,000. One wanted $3,500. One wanted $800 but the portfolio looked sketchy. He told himself he'd decide next month. Next month came and went. Then it was busy season. Then the holidays. "After the new year," he promised himself.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Dave landed a $4,000 bathroom remodel from a Google search. The customer told him, "I found you online and your reviews looked good." Dave didn't even remember getting that review—some happy customer had just left one. His "embarrassing" website had just paid for itself three times over in a single job.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Year Three</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Marcus decided he'd just build it himself. How hard could it be? He bought a Wix subscription, messed with it for two weekends, got frustrated, and never touched it again. The login sat in his email. He told himself he'd get back to it "when things slow down."
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Dave upgraded that embarrassing first site. Added some real photos. Got a few reviews. Nothing fancy, but Google knew who he was now. He was on page one for three different searches. Half his leads came from people who'd never heard of him until they Googled "emergency plumber near me."
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Year Four</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Marcus's Facebook page had 127 followers—mostly friends and family. He posted a job photo every few weeks. Sometimes it got 8 likes. He told himself that was enough. Besides, there was always something else. New tires for the van. Kid needed braces. He'd been eyeing that new drain camera—that felt more urgent than "website stuff."
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Dave was thinking about buying a second van. His phone rang enough that he was turning down jobs—something that would've been unthinkable in year one. He raised his prices. Customers still called. He started being pickier about which jobs he took.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Year Five</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Marcus still doesn't have a website. Good plumber. Great reputation among people who know him. But his business is stuck. Every customer comes from a referral or that Facebook page, which means growth is slow and unpredictable. He's exhausted. He talks about hiring someone, but the margins are too tight. He's still saying "I really need to get a website going."
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Dave has two trucks now. Hired his first employee last year. He's not working 80-hour weeks anymore because leads come in whether he's hustling or not. That "embarrassing" website from 2019? It's paid for itself a hundred times over.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          They still grab coffee sometimes. Marcus always says the same thing:
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed italic text-xl">
          "Man, I wish I'd just started when you did."
        </p>

        <div class="bg-cyan-900/20 border border-cyan-500/30 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <p class="text-cyan-300 font-bold mb-2">The difference wasn't talent. It wasn't luck. It wasn't money.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Dave started with "good enough." Marcus waited for "perfect." By the time perfect arrived, Dave was two years ahead—and that gap never closed.</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="border-cyan-500/30 my-12">

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">Now Let's Talk About You</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Maybe you see yourself in Marcus. Maybe you've been telling yourself the same things he did. "I'll get to it." "When things slow down." "When I figure out what I want."
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Here's the thing nobody tells you: <strong class="text-white">you'll never feel ready.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          There will always be something else. A busy season. A slow season. A thing you need to figure out first. A better time "next month." "Ready" is a myth. It's not a destination you arrive at. It's an excuse that feels productive because it sounds like a plan.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">The Excuses (And the Truth)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I've heard every excuse. I've even used some of them myself. So let me address them honestly:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6 my-8">
          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">"I don't have content ready."</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300"><strong class="text-cyan-400">The truth:</strong> You need four things—who you are, what you do, where you are, how to contact you. You can tell me that in a 10-minute phone call. Everything else is bonus.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">"I don't know what I want it to look like."</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300"><strong class="text-cyan-400">The truth:</strong> That's what designers are for. You wouldn't show up to a mechanic with a diagram of your engine. You just describe the problem and let them fix it.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">"I'm too busy running my business."</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300"><strong class="text-cyan-400">The truth:</strong> That's exactly WHEN you need a website. It works 24/7. It answers questions while you're on a job. It takes inquiries while you sleep. Being busy is a reason TO get one, not a reason to wait.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">"I get all my business from word of mouth."</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300"><strong class="text-cyan-400">The truth:</strong> Great. Now imagine those referrals Google you before calling—and they will. What do they find? Nothing? A competitor? A website makes your word-of-mouth referrals actually convert.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">"I'll do it when things slow down."</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300"><strong class="text-cyan-400">The truth:</strong> Things never slow down the way you think they will. And if they do? That's when you REALLY need a website—to bring in new business. Waiting for slow season is like waiting to fix the roof until it's raining.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400 mt-12 mb-4">Let's Do the Math</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">

          Dave's first website wasn't fancy. Here's what it had:

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-green-400 mb-4">Dave's "Embarrassing" First Site:</h3>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>✓ His name and business name</li>
            <li>✓ "Licensed plumber serving Lakewood and surrounding areas"</li>
            <li>✓ Phone number (big, clickable)</li>
            <li>✓ A contact form</li>
            <li>✓ Worked on phones</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-green-300 mt-4">That's it. No fancy photos. No video. No blog. Just the basics—and it was enough.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          He added real photos later. Got reviews later. Made it "nicer" later. But by then, Google already knew who he was. The head start mattered more than the polish.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">How long does it actually take to get a website?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">A basic professional website takes 2-4 weeks from start to live. Not months. Not "someday." If you started today, you'd have a website before the end of the month.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">What if I don't have my content ready?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">You don't need much. A good web designer can work with: who you are, what you do, how to contact you. That's literally enough to start. The rest can be added later.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">What if I'm not sure what I want my website to look like?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">That's literally our job. We ask questions, show you examples, and guide you through it. You don't need to come in with a vision. You just need to show up.</p>

          <div class="bg-black/40 border border-cyan-500/20 rounded-lg p-6">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-2">Is it too late if my business is already established?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">It's never too late, but every day you wait is another day your competitors are getting the customers who Googled you. The best time was years ago. The second best time is now.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          You're not going to feel ready. That feeling isn't coming.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          What IS coming is another month, another year, another batch of customers who Googled you, found nothing, and called someone else.

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          "Good enough now" beats "perfect someday." Every time.
