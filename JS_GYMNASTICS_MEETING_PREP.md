## 🔍 **WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THEM:**

### **Current Situation:**
- **Platform:** Wix (template-based, limited customization)
- **Problems:** Slow performance, can't customize, stuck with templates
- **Missing:** Online registration, payment processing, member portal, easy schedule updates
- **Location:** Beachwood, OH (YOU'RE LOCAL - big advantage!)

### **What They Likely Need:**
- Custom website (not template)
- Class schedule management (frequent updates)
- Coach/staff bios with photos
- Photo galleries of facility
- Contact forms
- Possibly: Online registration/payments (e-commerce)
- Possibly: Blog for news/updates

---

## 💬 **PART 1: DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (ASK FIRST - DON'T PITCH YET)**

**Your Goal:** Let them talk for 10-15 minutes. Take notes. Listen for pain points.

### **Questions to Ask:**

1. **"What made you want to explore a new website?"**
   - (Let them tell you what's broken with Wix)

2. **"What frustrates you most about your current site?"**
   - (Listen for: "It's slow," "Can't customize," "Hard to update," etc.)

3. **"How do you handle class registrations right now?"**
   - (Probably phone/email - painful!)

4. **"Do parents ever ask to register or pay online?"**
   - (If YES → they need e-commerce)

5. **"How often do you need to update your schedule or add new classes?"**
   - (If OFTEN → CMS is valuable)
   - (If RARELY → maybe full WaaS is better)

6. **"Who manages your website updates now?"**
   - (Are they hands-on or hands-off?)

7. **"What's your timeline? When do you want to launch?"**
   - (Shows urgency - good for closing)

8. **"What's your budget for this?"**
   - (DO NOT ask this first - ask last. But you need to know.)

---

## 🎨 **PART 2: POSITION AGAINST WIX**

**After they share their frustrations, say this:**

> "So right now you're on Wix, which is great for getting started, but it's really limiting for a business like yours. You can't customize it, it's slow, and you're stuck with their templates. Plus, every time you want to add a class or update a schedule, you have to fumble through their editor, right?"

**(Let them agree.)**

> "What I do is build **fully custom websites** specifically for businesses like Jump Start. Not templates - custom designed for YOU. And here's the key: I include a CMS - that's a content management system - so you can update schedules, swap photos, add news, whatever you need, all by yourself. No calling anyone, no waiting, no extra charges."

---

## 💰 **PART 3: PRESENT TWO OPTIONS (NOT SEVEN)**

**Don't overwhelm them. Show TWO clear options based on what you learned in discovery.**

---

### **OPTION 1: GROWTH HOSTING-ONLY ⭐ RECOMMENDED**

**When to pitch this:**
- If they update schedules frequently
- If they're somewhat tech-savvy
- If they want to save money

**What to say:**

> "Here's what I'd recommend for Jump Start: I build you a fully custom 10-page website. That includes:
> - Home page
> - Class schedules (organized by age group)
> - Coach/staff bios with photos
> - Photo gallery of your facility
> - Contact form
> - About/testimonials
> - News/updates section
> - Parent resources
> - Any other pages you need
>
> I also set up a **CMS** - that's basically an admin panel where you log in and manage your content. Need to add a Tuesday class for 6-year-olds? Log in, click 'Add New Class,' fill in the details - instructor, time, age group, price - hit publish. Takes 2 minutes. No calling me, no waiting.
>
> Same thing for swapping photos, updating hours, adding news - anything that's just content, you can do yourself.
>
> If you need a **design change** or a new **feature**, then you call me and I charge $75/hour. But day-to-day updates? You're in control.
>
> **Total cost: $3,497 to build it, then $69.99/month for hosting.** No long contract - cancel anytime after launch."

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fully custom (not Wix template)
- ✅ YOU manage day-to-day updates (freedom)
- ✅ $69.99/mo (way less than Wix + plugins)
- ✅ No contract after launch
- ✅ Local developer (I'm here in Cleveland)

**Your commission if they buy:**
- Setup: $1,049.10 (30% of $3,497)
- Monthly: $14/mo forever (20% of $69.99)

---

### **OPTION 2: GROWTH WaaS (If They're Hands-Off)**

**When to pitch this:**
- If they're NOT tech-savvy
- If they're too busy to manage updates
- If they want "set it and forget it"

**What to say:**

> "If you don't want to deal with updates yourself, I can handle that for you. Same custom 10-page site, but **I** do all the updates. You just email me 'Hey, add this new class on Tuesday' or 'Swap out coach Sarah's photo' and I do it - usually within 24 hours.
>
> Plus I do **ongoing SEO** - that means I'm working every month to help you show up higher on Google when parents search for 'gymnastics near me' or 'kids gymnastics Beachwood.' I optimize your pages, write blog posts, build backlinks - all to get you more students.
>
> **Total cost: $697 to build, then $252.50/month on a 24-month contract.** After 24 months, you can switch to hosting-only if you want."

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fully custom site
- ✅ I handle ALL updates (you do nothing)
- ✅ Ongoing SEO to get more students
- ✅ Priority support - I'm your web guy
- ✅ Local developer (I'm here in Cleveland)

**Your commission if they buy:**
- Setup: $209.10 (30% of $697)
- Monthly: $50.50/mo for 24 months (20% of $252.50)

---

### **🛒 ADD-ON: E-COMMERCE (Only Mention If They Need It)**

**If they said "YES" to online registration/payments, add this:**

> "One more thing: You mentioned parents ask to register online. I can add e-commerce for **$500 setup and $50/month**. That means parents can:
> - Register for classes online
> - Pay with credit card (Stripe or PayPal)
> - Buy team merchandise
> - Sign up for summer camps
> - Whatever you need.
>
> You manage it all through the CMS - add products, track orders, see payments."

**Total with E-commerce:**
- Growth Hosting-Only: $3,997 build + $119.99/mo
- Growth WaaS: $1,197 build + $302.50/mo

**Your commission with e-commerce:**
- Extra setup: $150 (30% of $500)
- Extra monthly: $10/mo forever (20% of $50)

---

## 🖥️ **PART 4: EXPLAIN CMS (THEY'LL ASK "WHAT'S A CMS?")**

**Simple explanation:**

> "A CMS is like the admin panel for your website. Think of it like Facebook's post editor, but for your whole site. You log in with a username and password, and you see a dashboard with all your content organized - Classes, Staff, Photos, Pages, etc.
>
> Want to add a new class? Click 'Classes' → 'Add New' → fill in the details → hit 'Publish.' Done. Takes 2 minutes.
>
> Want to swap a coach photo? Click 'Staff' → click the coach → upload new photo → save. Done. Takes 30 seconds.
>
> It's easier than posting on Facebook. No code, no technical stuff. Just clicking, typing, and saving."

**If they ask: "Is it hard?"**

> "Not at all. If you can post on Facebook or edit a Google Doc, you can use a CMS. I'll give you a 1-hour training call plus video tutorials. Most gym owners get the hang of it in 30 minutes."

**If they ask: "What if I break something?"**

> "You can't break the design or layout - that's locked down by me. You can only edit content like text, images, and schedules. And we have daily backups, so if something goes wrong, I can restore it in 5 minutes. But honestly, that almost never happens."

**If they ask: "Which CMS?"**

> "I'll use WordPress or Sanity - both are industry-standard, super reliable. WordPress is most popular and easiest to use. I'll recommend what's best for Jump Start and walk you through it."

---

## 🛡️ **PART 5: HANDLE OBJECTIONS**

### **Objection 1: "That's expensive."**

**Response:**

> "I get it - but let's compare. Right now you're on Wix, and I'm guessing you're paying what, $30-50/month? Plus you have to pay someone every time you need a change, which is probably $50-100 each time, right?
>
> With this, you pay $3,497 once, then $69.99/month - and you can make unlimited changes yourself for free. No more paying for every little update.
>
> Plus, you're getting a FULLY CUSTOM site - not a Wix template. Agencies charge $8,000-15,000 for what I'm building for $3,497. You're saving $5,000+ on the build alone."

### **Objection 2: "I need to think about it."**

**Response:**

> "Absolutely, take your time. Can I ask - what's holding you back? Is it the price, the timeline, or something else?"

**(Listen. Address their concern.)**

> "I'll send you a proposal today via email so you have everything in writing. But just so you know, I'm local here in Cleveland, and I'd love to work with Jump Start. I think we'd be a great fit."

### **Objection 3: "Can you do it cheaper?"**

**Response:**

> "I wish I could, but this is already priced below market. If you want to save money, you could go with the Starter tier instead - that's 5 pages instead of 10, and it's $2,497 to build with $49.99/month for hosting. Would that work better?"

**(If they say yes, great! If they say no, stick to your pricing.)**

### **Objection 4: "We need to talk to other developers first."**

**Response:**

> "Smart move - you should shop around. But here's what you'll find: most developers charge $5,000-10,000 just for the build, and they don't include hosting or a CMS. Plus, they're not local.
>
> I'm here in Cleveland, I'm giving you a fully custom site with CMS for $3,497, and I'm charging less than half what agencies charge for hosting. Just keep that in mind when you're comparing quotes."

### **Objection 5: "We need online registration ASAP."**

**Response:**

> "I can do that. With the e-commerce add-on, we can have you taking registrations online in 3-4 weeks. Parents register, pay with credit card, and you see everything in your dashboard. $500 setup, $50/month. Want me to include that in the proposal?"

---

## 🤝 **PART 6: CLOSE THE DEAL**

### **Trial Close (Mid-Meeting):**

**After presenting options, ask:**

> "Which of these sounds like a better fit for Jump Start - hosting-only where you manage updates, or full WaaS where I handle everything?"

**(Listen. They'll tell you what they prefer.)**

---

### **Final Close (End of Meeting):**

**If they're interested:**

> "Great! Here's what happens next:
> 1. I'll send you a proposal and contract today via email.
> 2. Once you sign and send the deposit ($1,748.50 - that's 50% of the build cost), I get started.
> 3. We do a kickoff call where I learn more about your brand, colors, content, etc.
> 4. I send you design mockups in 1 week for approval.
> 5. Once approved, I build it out in 2-3 weeks.
> 6. You review, we make revisions, then we launch.
>
> Timeline: **3-4 weeks from deposit to launch.** Sound good?"

**If they hesitate:**

> "No pressure at all. I'll send the proposal today and you take your time. But I'm excited about this - I think we'd do great work together. Any other questions I can answer?"

## 💡 **PRO TIPS FOR THE MEETING:**

1. **LISTEN MORE THAN YOU TALK** - Ask questions, take notes, let them share their pain.

2. **BE CONFIDENT (NOT DESPERATE)** - You're a professional developer. Act like it.

3. **USE "WE" LANGUAGE** - "When we build this..." "Once we launch..." (shows partnership)

4. **POSITION AS LOCAL** - "I'm here in Cleveland" = trust and accessibility.

5. **DON'T OVERSELL** - Two options. That's it. Don't confuse them with 7 tiers.

6. **ASK FOR THE SALE** - "Which option sounds better?" "When do you want to get started?"

7. **HANDLE OBJECTIONS CALMLY** - Don't get defensive. Listen, empathize, address.

8. **FOLLOW UP FAST** - Send proposal within 2 hours of meeting while you're fresh in their mind.

## 🎯 **YOUR ONE GOAL TODAY:**

**Close this deal.**

Walk out with:
- ✅ A signed contract, OR
- ✅ A clear "send me the proposal" commitment, OR
- ✅ At minimum, a clear next step ("We'll decide by Friday")

**Don't walk out with a vague "We'll think about it and get back to you."**

---

## 🚀 **YOU'VE GOT THIS!**

This is your first client meeting. You're nervous. That's normal.

But remember:
- You're offering a better solution than Wix
- You're local (huge advantage)
- Your pricing is fair and competitive
- You know your stuff (you built a whole CRM!)
- They NEED a new website (why else would they meet with you?)

Be confident. Be professional. Listen. Ask questions. Present two clear options. Close the deal.

**You can do this.**

---

## 📞 **EMERGENCY CONTACT (DURING MEETING):**

If you get stuck or need help during the meeting, text yourself: "Pause, breathe, ask a question."

If they ask something you don't know: "Great question - let me get back to you on that after the meeting so I can give you the most accurate answer."

---

**Good luck! Go close your first sale. 🎉**
