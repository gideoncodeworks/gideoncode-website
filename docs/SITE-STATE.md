## Site State – 2025-11-07

Snapshot reference for current production-ready layout after the latest nav/CTA/portfolio/about updates.

### Navigation
- Desktop nav now shows `Web Services`, `CRM Platform`, `Portfolio` as primary links.
- `More` menu contains `Join Sales Team`, `About`, `Contact`, `FAQ`.
- Mobile menu mirrors this ordering; `Get Started` button links to `package-builder.html`.

### Services Page
- All “Get Started” buttons route to `package-builder.html`.
- Gideon builder vs selector CTA lives directly above the footer.
- Add-on section lists Gideon AI (Basic/Pro), Social Media, Google Ads, SEO Starter/Growth with “Configure in Builder” CTAs.
- Feature comparison drawer uses the new neon grid styling.

### Portfolio Page
- Hero now uses an inline two-column layout with `gideon-lives.mp4` beside the intro copy (no separate showcase block).
- Projects grouped into three sections: Client Launches, SaaS + Internal Tools, Demo Library.
- “Start Your Project” button links to `get-started.html`.

### About Page
- Hero → Gideon briefing → chapter nav (Origin, Pivot, AI Engine, Revenue Studio, AE Program) with a metrics band for proof.
- Founder story rewritten into anchored chapter cards with CTA buttons (Build with Gideon / Join the Sales Engine).
- Bottom half consolidated into a single “Operating System” block instead of separate What We Do / Mission / Values sections.

### Get Started Page
- Includes Gideon CTA explaining Package Builder vs Plan Selector directly under the hero.
- Three-option section (Contact, Builder, AI Wizard) remains unchanged below.

### Package Builder
- Pricing aligned with Services: Growth WaaS at $297/$252.50, Domination at $349/$299.
- One-time builds mention support windows (30/60/90 days).
- Add-ons mirror Services (Gideon AI tiers + SEO packages).

### Careers Page
- Hero pairs the recruit copy with the Gideon video inline; CTA row links to the comp plan, “See What You’ll Sell” platform preview, and Apply.
